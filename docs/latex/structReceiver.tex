\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Struct representing a \doxyref{Receiver}{p.}{structReceiver}. Essentially, it is an always running thread listening for incoming packets on a defined protocol on a given port.

It has the following fields\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+proto} is a pointer to a {\ttfamily protoent} structure defining which protocol is used
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+address} is a {\ttfamily sockaddr\+\_\+in} value containing the IP address on which the receiver is binded
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+socket} is just the file descriptor of the created socket
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+running} a boolean indicating if the receiver is running or not
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+verbose} A flag to enable verbosity
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+timer} A timer shared with the \doxyref{Sender}{p.}{structSender}
\item {\ttfamily \+\_\+mutex} A simple Mutex to syncrhonize with the sender 
\end{DoxyItemize}
